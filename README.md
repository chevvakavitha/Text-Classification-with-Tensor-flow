## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/text-classification-tf.git
   cd text-classification-tf

---

### Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
This example uses a sample dataset (e.g., IMDb movie reviews or a custom dataset). Ensure your dataset is in CSV or TXT format and includes:

text: The input text.
label: The target class.

## Model Architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

---

## Usage
Preprocess your data:
Tokenize and pad text using TensorFlow's Tokenizer API.
Encode labels into integers or one-hot format.

### Train the model:
python train.py
